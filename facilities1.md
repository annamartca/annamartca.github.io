The Cell Profiling facility at [**SciLifeLab**](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/cell-profiling/) enables researchers to access the resources and expertise from the Human Protein Atlas, by providing high-throughput profiling of protein targets in individual cells using immunofluorescence. Based on the resource of more than 47,000 antibodies and a panel of >20 different human cell lines, this facility has a unique position to investigate subcellular spatial proteomics for human and rodent biology. This is ideal for functional validation of discoveries/hits from large-scale omics projects in human cells. For users wanting to image at even higher resolution (STED, SIM etc.), the Cell Profiling facility can assist in sample preparation and evaluation of suitable antibodies for super-resolution microscopy.

The facility also support study design, image analysis and statistical analysis of data.
