* High-throughput profiling of protein targets in single cells using multiplexed immunofluorescence and fluorescent bioimaging.
* Analysis in cell line of choice or from a standardized panel of >20 human/rodent cell lines.
* Quantitative image analysis at a single cell level (for example co-localization of targets).
* siRNA downregulation of target proteins.
* IF application testing of antibodies.
