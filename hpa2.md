The team behind the Cell Atlas of the Human Protein Atlas has opened up an online machine learning competition that will award USD 37,000 to be split among the creators of the best algorithms for classifying protein expression in images of human cells. The competition will run for 90 days beginning October 3, 2018, on Kaggle.com.

*Images visualizing proteins in cells are commonly used for biomedical research, and these cells could hold the keys for the next breakthrough in medicine. However, thanks to advances in high-throughput microscopy, these images are generated at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated.*

There's a great need for an enhanced automation of biomedical image analysis to accelerate the understanding of human cells and disease", says KTH researcher Emma Lundberg, who directs the Cell Atlas project, part of the Human Protein Atlas at the Science for Life Laboratory joint research center in Stockholm.
